It's built on the Bootstrap framework and includes pre-packaged syntax highlighting ( highlight.js ), icons ( FontAwesome ), and a theme based on PSReadLine 's default colors for a PowerShell console-themed documentation site. You are looking at the theme and can see a selection of the theme elements on the Specimen page . Install Required : Python 2.6+ or 3.3+ Install MkDocs & Create a New Project If you haven't installed MkDocs yet, use the following command to install it: $ pip install mkdocs Next, navigate to a clean directory and create a new MkDocs project with the following command: $ mkdocs new [projectname] Replace [projectname] with the name of your project (without the brackets). Then navigate to the root of your project directory: $ cd [projectname] Install the Psinder Theme Choose one of the following install approaches: 1. Install with pip If you are using MkDocs v0.15.0 or higher, you can install the Psinder theme with pip using the command: $ pip install mkdocs-psinder MkDocs projects use a YAML settings file called mkdocs.yml . This is located in the root of your project directory after you use the mkdocs new command. Open the file in a text editor and modify it to define Psinder in the theme setting as follows (note that this is case-sensitive): site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme: psinder pages: - Home: index.md Theme Updates : If you choose the pip install approach, you can update your Psinder theme to new releases with the command $ pip install --upgrade mkdocs-psinder . Then re-build your static site files (see instructions below). 2. Manual Install Download the Psinder theme archive. Download Psinder v0.3.0 Unpack the contents of the archive into a directory named psinder at the top level of your MkDocs project directory. Your project directory should now look like this: \u251c\u2500\u2500 mkdocs.yml \u251c\u2500\u2500 psinder \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 css \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 img \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 js \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 base.html \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 content.html \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 404.html \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 nav-sub.html \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 nav.html \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 toc.html \u2514\u2500\u2500 docs \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.md MkDocs projects use a YAML settings file called mkdocs.yml . This is located in the root of your project directory after you use the mkdocs new command. Open the file in a text editor and modify it to include the theme_dir setting as follows: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme_dir: psinder pages: - Home: index.md Theme Updates : If you choose the manual install approach, you can update your Psinder theme by downloading the new psinder.zip release archive and including it in your project. Then re-build your static site files (see instructions below). Test with a Local Site Server Use the following command to establish a local server for your site: $ mkdocs serve Then open your site in any browser at the URL http://localhost:8000 . Create Your Site Add Content with Markdown Syntax Get to work on your site home page by opening the docs/index.md file and editing it in Markdown syntax. The HTML automatically updates in the browser when you save the Markdown file if you use the MkDocs server (see command above). Add New Pages Add new pages to your site by creating a new Markdown file in your docs directory, then linking to the new page in the mkdocs.yml file. This uses a Page Name : Markdown file syntax. For example, to add an About page using a Markdown file that is located on the path docs/about.md , you would format the mkdocs.yml file as follows: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme_dir: psinder pages: - Home: index.md - About: about.md Add additional pages to your site by repeating the above series of steps. Build Your Site Build your site files with the command: $ mkdocs build Your site files are built in the site directory and are ready to use. Deploy the contents of the site directory to your web server. Site Customization The following are a few common customizations that you might be interested in. For much more detail about the configuration of your site, check out the MkDocs Configuration documentation . Site Favicon Place your site favicon image file in the top level of your docs directory and then include a new site_favicon: field in the mkdocs.yml file: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme_dir: psinder site_favicon: favicon.ico pages: - Home: index.md - About: about.md Add Your Own CSS Stylesheets Create a css directory inside your docs directory and add your CSS files. You can overwrite any of the Psinder styles in your CSS files. Then include your CSS files in the mkdocs.yml file with the extra_css field: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme_dir: psinder extra_css: - \"css/mystyle.css\" - \"css/myotherstyle.css\" pages: - Home: index.md - About: about.md Your CSS styles fall at the end of the cascade and will override all styles included in the theme (including Bootstrap and default Psinder styles). You can find the Psinder and Bootstrap CSS files on the paths psinder/css/psinder.css and psinder/css/bootstrap.min.css , respectively. Add Your Own JavaScript Create a js directory inside your docs directory and add your JS files. Then include your JS files in the mkdocs.yml file with the extra_js field: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme_dir: psinder extra_js: - \"js/myscript.js\" - \"js/myotherscript.js\" pages: - Home: index.md - About: about.md Github or Bitbucket Repository Link Include the repo_url field and define it with your repository URL: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme_dir: psinder repo_url: \"https://github.com/michaeltlombardi/mkdocs-psinder\" pages: - Home: index.md - About: about.md The link appears at the upper right hand corner of your site. License Declaration and Link The Psinder theme displays your license declaration in the footer if you include a copyright field and define it with the text (and optionally the HTML link) that you would like to display: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme_dir: psinder copyright: \"Psinder is licensed under the &lt;a href='https://github.com/michaeltlombardi/mkdocs-psinder/blob/master/LICENSE.md'&gt;MIT license</a>\" pages: - Home: index.md - About: about.md Issues If you have any issues with the theme, please report them on the Psinder repository: Report Issue Active Issues License Psinder is licensed under the MIT license.
